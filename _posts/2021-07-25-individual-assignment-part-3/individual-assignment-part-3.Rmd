## Insights and Conlusions

### Question 1 
Using just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words. 

#### Q1 Most popular locations
The top 3 popular locations belong to the Food categories, such as Katerina's Cafe, Brew've Been Served and Hippokampos. Katerina's Cafe peaks on Saturday, Hippokampus is busier on weekdays than weekends and Brew've been Served is closed on weekends.

#### Q1 Anomaly - Credit Card Posting at Fixed Hour
Some locations only have credit card transactions posted in 1 hour within the day e.g. Bean There Done That and Brewed Awakenings, Jack's Magical Beans, Coffee Shack at 12PM.
Corrections: Correct posting timing if GPS record shows otherwise.

#### Q1 Anomaly - Kronos Mart Post Credit Card Record 1 Day Late
Kronos Mart's credit card postings usually come 1 day late, which result in strange timing of postings at 3-9AM. 
Corrections: Correct posting timing based on available GPS record or take the date of loyalty card record.

#### Q1 Anomaly - Cashbacks in Multiples of $20
Some loyalty card transactions have prices lower than the corresponding credit card transactions. The denominations are usually in multiples of $20, ranging from $20 to $80. Locations vary widely, suggesting a loyalty cashback scheme. 
Corrections: Use credit card amount as loyalty price is non-consequential to investigation.

#### Q1 Anomaly - Multiple Credit Cards to Loyalty Cards
Unexpected relationships between credit card 1286 and loyalty card L3288, and loyalty card L6267 is associated with credit cards 6691 & 6899.
Corrections: Care was taken to join credit card and loyalty card transactions to prevent duplication.

#### Q1 Anomaly - High Spend Due to Possible Fraud
The highest spend on the credit card is $10k on Frydos Autospply n' More that does not have a loyalty card transaction, belonging to credit card 9551. 9 credit cards register many high spends that are at industrial areas tying to the 9 truck drivers. The other highest spend that is not in industrial location is on Albert's Fine Clothing by credit card 1321. 
![Figure 6: Distribution of Cashback Amount by Locations](./images/Q1_highspend.png){#id .class width=100%}

We noticed that there is a gap between the the $10k spend on 13 Jan and the next purchase by credit card 9551 on 16 Jan. This suggests that the high spend might be due to fraud.

#### Q1 Anomaly - Sparse Spends due to Multiple Cards 



### Question 2
Add the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 500 words.

Bean There Done That, Brewed Awakenings and Jack's Magic Beans only operate in weekday mornings and posted credit card transactions at 12 noon.

#### Q2 Anomaly - Gustav(9)'s Mismatch of Credit Card Location and GPS Location
